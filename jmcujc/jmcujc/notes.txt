  ( ) might be best to move dc differential coding to step before huffman coding.
  ( ) try to keep all members of params struct const?
  ( ) replace bytearray with bitarray
  ( ) rename bit_dispenser.h to bit_packer.h and remove references to the dispensers
  ( ) pass up errors through call chain
         ( ) data overrun in bitpacker
         ( ) malformed data
         ( ) bad huffman table
  ( ) circumnavigate inline + -Wunused-function


Bugs fixed:
  * _RBIT function I wrote for x86 didn't work right.
  * This one was interesting: after I made the decision to switch all sample data to floating
    point, there was an == 0 check in a for loop in the AC Huffman coding section that stopped
    working.
