This directory contains a C-based JPEG compressor which compresses PNM images.

I chose to develop this first merely as an exercise to fully familiarize myself with the JPEG
standard before trying to progress to the verilog implementation

For simplicity, we assume that all images have a bit depth of 8 bits. For now, we also have all
images as grayscale, but I may improve that later on.

should rename this folder "reference implementation"
