JFPJC: "John's Field-Programmable JPEG Compressor"

I want to have a better name for this project.

What's the POINT of it? What are some salient features?

  * I want to do it
  * I want to cut corners for the sake of power consumption
  * It will probably suck
  * It's a hardware device.
  * It's a straightforward adaptation of standard

Name ideas:
    jeez - jpeg squeeze
    Short, but not descriptive in terms of what it is and why it's being made.

    fdjc - field-deployable jpeg compressor (as in FPGA)
    Short, descriptive, but not unique enough?
    maybe jfdjc
